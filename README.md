# ClassroomGroupEngagement
Classroom group engagement helps students share knowledge and build a more complete understanding. Recognition of engagement in the classroom helps us understand the students’ learning state and optimize the teaching and study processes. Currently,  the main datasets in engagement recognition are mainly based on individual student engagement analysis using computer-based learning in the lab,  lacking of datasets on more holistic perspective. Classroom Group engagement can capture the students interaction,  cooperation,  and the overall classroom atmosphere,  which holds far more value in educational research. However, the lack of publicly available recognition datasets poses a challenge for researchers in this field. To address this issue, we propose a classroom group engagement dataset (OUC-CGE) that reflects real-life scenarios. In this paper, based on non-invasive classroom videos, a classroom learning group engagement database was constructed. We collected 7, 705 video clips of 17 participants. Unlike the existing engagement datasets,  we take the whole classroom as the research object. Students group engagement performance can be evaluated objectively and automatically utilizing classroom information. Several classical models are tested on OUC-CGE,  and the experimental results show that OUC-CGE exhibits good consistency and discriminability with existing datasets. OUC-CGE can be used as a benchmark dataset for future research in students group engagement applying models to predict classroom group engagement levels and promote the development of engagement recognition research.
